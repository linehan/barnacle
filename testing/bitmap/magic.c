 *
 * The population count of a binary integer value x is the number of one 
 * bits in the value. Although many machines have single instructions for 
 * this, the single instructions are usually microcoded loops that test a 
 * bit per cycle; a log-time algorithm coded in C is often faster. 
 *
 * The following code uses a variable-precision SWAR algorithm to perform 
 * a tree reduction adding the bits in a 32-bit value:
 *
 * It is worthwhile noting that the SWAR population count algorithm given 
 * above can be improved upon for the case of counting the population of 
 * multi-word bit sets. How? The last few steps in the reduction are using 
 * only a portion of the SWAR width to produce their results; thus, it 
 * would be possible to combine these steps across multiple words being 
 * reduced.
 *
 * One additional note: the AMD Athlon optimization guidelines suggest a 
 * very similar algorithm that replaces the last three lines with 
 *
 *      return((x * 0x01010101) >> 24);
 *
 * For the Athlon (which has a very fast integer multiply), I would have 
 * expected AMD's code to be faster... but it is actually 6% slower 
 * according to my benchmarks using a 1.2GHz Athlon (a Thunderbird). Why? 
 * Well, it so happens that GCC doesn't use a multiply instruction - it 
 * writes out the equivalent shift and add sequence!

/* 
 * pow2 -- Return the next highest power of 2 of v
 * @v: unsigned 32-bit integer value
 *
 * In 12 operations, this code computes the next highest power of 2 for a 
 * 32-bit integer. The result may be expressed by the formula 
 *
 *      1U << (lg(v - 1) + 1). 
 *
 * Note that in the edge case where v is 0, it returns 0, which isn't a 
 * power of 2; you might append the expression v += (v == 0) to remedy this 
 * if it matters. 
 *
 * It would be faster by 2 operations to use the formula and the log base 2 
 * method that uses a lookup table, but in some situations, lookup tables are 
 * not suitable, so the above code may be best. (On a Athlonâ„¢ XP 2100+ I've 
 * found the above shift-left and then OR code is as fast as using a single 
 * BSR assembly language instruction, which scans in reverse to find the 
 * highest set bit.) 
 *
 * It works by copying the highest set bit to all of the 
 * lower bits, and then adding one, which results in carries that set all of 
 * the lower bits to 0 and one bit beyond the highest set bit to 1. If the 
 * original number was a power of 2, then the decrement will reduce it to one 
 * less, so that we round up to the same original value.
