/*****************************************************************************
* This program implements the Mersenne twister algorithm for generation of   *
* pseudorandom numbers. The program returns random integers in the range 0   *
* to 2^32-1 (this holds even if a long int is larger than 32 bits). Timing   *
* with gcc indicates that it is about twice as fast as the built in rand     *
* function. The original code was written by Michael Brundage and has been   *
* placed in the public domain. There are a three minor changes here:         *
*                                                                            *
*   (1) This comment has been added to the program.                          *
*   (2) Type specifiers (ul) have been appended to constants.                *
*   (3) A commented out block near the end has been removed.                 *
