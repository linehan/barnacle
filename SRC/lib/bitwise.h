  The subexpression (v - 0x01010101UL), evaluates to a high bit set in any 
  byte whenever the corresponding byte in v is zero or greater than 0x80. 
  The sub-expression ~v & 0x80808080UL evaluates to high bits set in bytes 
  where the byte of v doesn't have its high bit set (so the byte was less 
  than 0x80). Finally, by ANDing these two sub-expressions the result is 
  the high bits set where the bytes in v were zero, since the high bits 
  set due to a value greater than 0x80 in the first sub-expression are 
  masked off by the second. 

  Juha JÃ¤rvi suggested hasless(v, 1) on April 6, 2005, which he found on 
  Paul Hsieh's Assembly Lab; previously it was written in a newsgroup post 
  on April 27, 1987 by Alan Mycroft.

  We may want to know if any byte in a word has a specific value. To do 
  so, we can XOR the value to test with a word that has been filled with 
  the byte values in which we're interested. Because XORing a value with 
  itself results in a zero byte and nonzero otherwise, we can pass the 
  result to haszero. 

  Stephen M Bennet suggested this on December 13, 2009 after reading the 
  entry for haszero.
