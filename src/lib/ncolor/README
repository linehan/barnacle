ncolor is a simple library for manipulating colors on terminals
which include programmable 256-color support. It provides handles
to ncurses color functions, but builds unified color palettes from
.ggr (GIMP Gradient) files rather than magic numbers specified at
compile time.

To see it in action, make sure you have a 256-color terminal and 
the latest version of ncurses installed, and build the test program
with 
        make

Then, execute the compiled test program, supplying one of the .ggr
files in the "samples" directory as an argument. 

        ./test samples/somepalette.ggr

You can specify any path to any .ggr file, of course (so long as it
has less than 256 colors).
