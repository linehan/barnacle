         * aspect ratio of 0.55, with an x-width of 0.54, at 100pt.
         * That is, a given character -- or more precisely, the uniform
         * rectangle that holds each individual glyph -- is a little over
         * half as wide as it is tall.
         *
         * The plate carree or equirectangular projection that we use as
         * the basis for our world map is bounded by a rectangle with an
         * aspect ratio of 2:1, that is, twice as wide as it is tall.
         * 
         * We must determine, then, the appropriate aspect ratio of a 2:1
         * equirectangular figure, with the stipulation that each of its
         * component rectangles has an individual aspect ratio of .55:1.
         *
         * The math is straightforward:  2/.55 = ~3.6
         *
         * In other words, for a given map, we need 3.6 units of width for 
         * every unit of height, as long as we are using DejaVu Mono and 
         * the venerable plate carree. 
         *
         * In addition, the height value should be a multiple of 6, because
         * there are six major climate zones, or rather three, symmetric
         * across the equator: polar, subtropical, and tropical. Ideally,
         * each of these should be represented by at least one PLATE each.
