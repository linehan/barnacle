  What is it?
  -----------

  Arawak is a game for you and your text terminal. 

  There are a number of high quality terminal emulators today that 
  support rich features like UTF-8 character glyphs and 256-color 
  output, meaning the command line has never looked better. In fact, 
  it can look unreasonably good, considering the age of terminal 
  technology. The goal here is to challenge the limits of 
  unreasonability, of course!
