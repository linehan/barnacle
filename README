  What is it?
  -----------

  Barnacle is a game for you and your text terminal. 

  There are a number of high quality terminal emulators today that 
  support rich features like UTF-8 character glyphs and 256-color 
  output, meaning the command line has never looked better. In fact, 
  it can look unreasonably good, considering the age of terminal 
  technology. The goal here is to challenge the limits of 
  unreasonability, of course!

  Additional documentation is coming soon... 


  System Requirements
  -------------------

  Barnacle can be installed on any Linux system, provided certain
  dependencies are also installed. All are free and open source
  software. Consult your distribution's package management system, 
  or install them from source code. More information can be found
  at the project pages listed below:

        - libev event loop library
          http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html

        - ncurses terminal drawing library
          http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/

        - rxvt-unicode terminal emulator
          http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html 

        - DejaVu fonts
          http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page

        - GNU Unifont Glyphs 
          http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html 

  If you are unsure whether your system meets these dependencies,
  run the depcheck.sh shell script that should have been included
  with this software. It's currently a bit crude, but it will do 
  its best to put you on the right track.


  Installation
  ------------

  At this point, the only way to install Barnacle is to compile 
  the binary from source. This is something that will be 
  streamlined in the near future.


  Keyboard Controls
  -----------------

  At the moment, the controls call for both hands to operate two
  familiar control clusters. On the left, the w-a-s-d keys familiar
  to any first person shooter fan. On the right, the h-j-k-l keys,
  beloved by users of a certain text editor. At the moment, the right
  hand controls movement, while the left hand controls attacks in the
  supplied direction. Additional mappings will soon be supported by a 
  config file.
